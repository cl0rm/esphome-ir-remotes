 Description Files and Remote Codes for some of my devices.

 You definitely have to modify those files for your needs (change GPIO and encryption/Wifi settings).

 The important part should work however: The remote codes

 ## Devices
 - Panasonic Plasma TVs (should work for all of them and even many LCDs- Tested on TX-P42GW10E)
 - YAMAHA CDC CD Players/changers (that's really why this exists - Hard to find the codes)
    - CDC-845
    - CDC-675
